DigituSync,DigituSync: A Dual-User Passive Exoskeleton Glove That Adaptively Shares Hand Gestures,"Jun Nishida, Yudai Tanaka, Romain Nith and Pedro Lopes",UIST2022,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3526113.3545630,https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1kGcBwu9hYt8YHRZGPABI8eAdGgI7U-4B,https://youtu.be/XpOKhXOXnt8,"We engineered DigituSync, a passive-exoskeleton that physically links two hands together, enabling two users to adaptively transmit finger movements in real-time. It uses multiple four-bar linkages to transfer both motion and force, while still preserving congruent haptic feedback. Moreover, we implemented a variable-length linkage that allows adjusting the force transmission ratio between the two users and regulates the amount of intervention, which enables users to customize their learning experience. DigituSync's benefits emerge from its passive design: unlike existing haptic devices (motor-based exoskeletons or electrical muscle stimulation), DigituSync has virtually no latency and does not require batteries/electronics to transmit or adjust movements, making it useful and safe to deploy in many settings, such as between students and teachers in a classroom. We validated DigituSync by means of technical evaluations and a user study, demonstrating that it instantly transfers finger motions and forces with the ability of adaptive force transmission, which allowed participants to feel more control over their own movements and to feel the teacher's intervention was more responsive. We also conducted two exploratory sessions with a music teacher and deaf-blind users, which allowed us to gather experiential insights from the teacher's side and explore DigituSync in applications."
HandMorph,HandMorph: a Passive Exoskeleton that Miniaturizes Grasp,"Jun Nishida, Soichiro Matsuda, Hiroshi Matsui, Shan-Yuan Teng, Ziwei Liu, Kenji Suzuki and Pedro Lopes",UIST2020,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3379337.3415875,https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1kGcBwu9hYt8YHRZGPABI8eAdGgI7U-4B,https://youtu.be/5o2wPy5hl0w,"We engineered an exoskeleton, which we call HandMorph, that approximates the experience of having a smaller grasping range. It uses mechanical links to transmit motion from the wearer's fingers to a smaller hand with five anatomically correct fingers. The result is that HandMorph miniaturizes a wearer's grasping range while transmitting haptic feedback.
Unlike other size-illusions based on virtual reality, HandMorph achieves this in the user's real environment, preserving the user's physical and social contexts. As such, our device can be integrated into the user's workflow, e.g., to allow product designers to momentarily change their grasping range into that of a child while evaluating a toy prototype.
In our first user study, we found that participants perceived objects as larger when wearing HandMorph, which suggests that their size perception was successfully transformed. In our second user study, we assessed the experience of using HandMorph in designing a simple toy trumpet for children. We found that participants felt more confident in their toy design when using HandMorph to validate its ergonomics."
CHILDHOOD,Egocentric Smaller-person Experience by Changing a Visual Perspective,"Jun Nishida, Soichiro Matsuda, Mika Oki, Hikaru Takatori, Kosuke Sato and Kenji Suzuki",CHI2019,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300926,https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1kGcBwu9hYt8YHRZGPABI8eAdGgI7U-4B,https://vimeo.com/120369920,"This paper explores how human perceptions, actions, and interactions can be changed through an embodied and active experience of being a smaller person in a real-world environment, which we call an egocentric smaller person experience. We developed a wearable visual translator that provides the perspective of a smaller person by shifting the wearer's eyesight level down to their waist using a head-mounted display and a stereo camera module, while allowing for field of view control through head movements. In this study, we investigated how the developed device can modify the wearer's body representation and experiences based on a field study conducted at a nursing school and museums, and through lab studies. It was observed that the participants changed their perceptions, actions, and interactions because they are considered to have perceived themselves as being smaller. Using this device, designers and teachers can understand the perspectives of other people in an existing environment."
bioSync,bioSync: A Paired Wearable Device for Blending Kinesthetic Experience,Jun Nishida and Kenji Suzuki,CHI2017,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3025453.3025829,https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1kGcBwu9hYt8YHRZGPABI8eAdGgI7U-4B,https://vimeo.com/155394019,"We present a novel, paired, wearable system for combining the kinesthetic experiences of two persons. These devices allow users to sense and combine muscle contraction and joint rigidity bi-directionally. This is achieved through kinesthetic channels based on electromyogram (EMG) measurement and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). We developed a pair of wearable kinesthetic input-output (I/O) devices called bioSync that uses specially designed electrodes to perform biosignal measurement and stimulation simultaneously on the same electrodes.
In a user study, participants successfully evaluated the strength of their partners' muscle contractions while exerting their own muscles. We confirmed that the pair of devices could help participants synchronize their hand movements through tapping, without visual and auditory feedback. The proposed interpersonal kinesthetic communication system can be used to enhance interactions such as clinical gait rehabilitation and sports training, and facilitate sharing of physical experiences with Parkinson's patients, thereby enhancing understanding of the physical challenges they face in daily life."
Whose touch is this?,Whose touch is this?: Understanding the Agency Trade-off Between User-driven touch vs. Computer-driven Touch,"Daisuke Tajima, Jun Nishida, Pedro Lopes, Shunichi Kasahara",TOCHI,https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3489608,https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1kGcBwu9hYt8YHRZGPABI8eAdGgI7U-4B,,"Force-feedback enhances digital touch by enabling users to share non-verbal aspects such as rhythm, poses, and so on. To achieve this, interfaces actuate the user’s to touch involuntarily (using exoskeletons or electrical-muscle-stimulation); we refer to this as computer-driven touch. Unfortunately, forcing users to touch causes a loss of their sense of agency. While researchers found that delaying the timing of computer-driven touch preserves agency, they only considered the naïve case when user-driven touch is aligned with computer-driven touch. We argue this is unlikely as it assumes we can perfectly predict user-touches. But, what about all the remainder situations: when the haptics forces the user into an outcome they did not intend or assists the user in an outcome they would not achieve alone? We unveil, via an experiment, what happens in these novel situations. From our findings, we synthesize a framework that enables researchers of digital-touch systems to trade-off between haptic-assistance vs. sense-of-agency."
Agency Drives Learning,Agency Drives Learning: Preserving Agency During Muscle Stimulation Speeds up Reaction Time,,CHI2021,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445147,https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1kGcBwu9hYt8YHRZGPABI8eAdGgI7U-4B,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVpUu9tCLtY,"Force feedback devices, such as motor-based exoskeletons or wearables based on electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), have the unique potential to accelerate users’ own reaction time (RT). However, this speedup has only been explored while the device is attached to the user. In fact, very little is known regarding whether this faster reaction time still occurs after the user removes the device from their bodies–this is precisely what we investigated by means of a simple reaction time (RT) experiment, in which participants were asked to tap as soon as they saw an LED flashing. Participants experienced this in three EMS conditions: (1) fast-EMS, the electrical impulses were synced with the LED; (2) agency-EMS, the electrical impulse was delivered 40ms faster than the participant’s own RT, which prior work has shown to preserve one’s sense of agency over this movement; and, (3) late-EMS: the impulse was delivered after the participant’s own RT. Our results revealed that the participants’ RT was significantly reduced by approximately 8ms (up to 20ms) only after training with the agency-EMS condition. This finding suggests that the prioritizing agency during EMS training is key to motor-adaptation, i.e., it enables a faster motor response even after the user has removed the EMS device from their body."
Preemptive Action,Preemptive Action: Accelerating Human Reaction using Electrical Muscle Stimulation Without Compromising Agency,,CHI2019,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3300873,https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1kGcBwu9hYt8YHRZGPABI8eAdGgI7U-4B,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BT8REEJibM,"We enable preemptive force-feedback systems to speed up human reaction time without fully compromising the user's sense of agency. Typically these interfaces actuate by means of electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) or mechanical actuators; they preemptively move the user to perform a task, such as to improve movement performance (e.g., EMS-assisted drumming). Unfortunately, when using preemptive force-feedback users do not feel in control and loose their sense of agency. We address this by actuating the user's body, using EMS, within a particular time window (160 ms after visual stimulus), which we found to speed up reaction time by 80 ms in our first study. With this preemptive timing, when the user and system move congruently, the user feels that they initiated the motion, yet their reaction time is faster than usual. As our second study demonstrated, this particular timing significantly increased agency when compared to the current practice in EMS-based devices. We conclude by illustrating, using examples from the HCI literature, how to leverage our findings to provide more agency to automated haptic interfaces."

Integrating computers with the human body is not new. however, we believe that with rapid technological advancements, increasing real-world deployments, and growing ethical and societal implications, it is critical to identify an agenda for future research. We present a set of challenges for HInt research, formulated over the course of a five-day workshop consisting of 29 experts who have designed, deployed and studied HInt systems. This agenda aims to guide researchers in a structured way towards a more coordinated and conscientious future of human-computer integration."
