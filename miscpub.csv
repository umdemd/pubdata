ShadowClones,ShadowClones: an Interface to Maintain a Multiple Sense of Body-space Coordination in Multiple Visual Perspectives,"Kazuma Takada, Nanako Kumasaki, Tom Froese, Kazuhisa Shibata, Jun Nishida, and Shunichi Kasahara",AugmentedHumans 2023,2023,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3582700.3582706,,https://youtu.be/UGXvYPcW3Jc?si=kVVSpOISPbOXuWVY,"In this paper, we propose ShadowClones, an interface that supports interactions in which a single user can interact with multiple bodies in multiple spaces. Recent teleoperation technologies have allowed a user controlling multiple objects simultaneously, but at the same time, it also exhibited a significant challenge, which can be attributed to the high cognitive load caused by switching and recogning various spaces/perspectives repeatedly and instantly. To tackle this challenge, by taking advantage of pre-attentive visual cues for users’ simultaneous information processing, we designed and evaluated a new user interface, called Shadow Clones, that projects self-body information in unattended areas for increasing the awareness of body-space relationships and allowing users to seamlessly switch across different visual perspectives from avatars or remote robots. We then explored the proposed approach through a simple visual reaching task with a performance evaluation in terms of task completion time and success rate. The results showed superior performance when compared with a condition that presents no projections of users’ body movements in unattended areas. We conclude by discussing possible mechanisms of this enhancement as well as two potential scenarios using the shadow clones approach, including new entertainment content for virtual reality e-sports and multiple robot teleoperation such as in a construction site or a disaster site, without compromising operational performance.",
Magnus,Demonstrating Magnus: A Magnetic Hand Exoskeleton for Fast and Dexterous Finger Actuation,"Jun Nishida, Daisuke Tajima, Yasuko Namikawa and Shunichi Kasahara",ACM SIGGRAPH 2023 Emerging Technologies,2023,,,,"We developed a magnetic hand exoskeleton that can provide high-speed finger actuation, allowing to assist fast finger drumming and eSports",
MorphingIdentity,A Demonstration of Morphing Identity: Exploring Self-Other Identity Continuum through Interpersonal Facial Morphing,"Kye Shimizu, Santa Naruse, Jun Nishida, and Shunichi Kasahara",ACM SIGGRAPH 2022 Emerging Technologies,2022,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3588037.3595394,,,"We explored continuous changes in self-other identity by designing an interpersonal facial morphing experience where the facial images of two users are blended and then swapped over time. To explore this with diverse social relationships, we conducted qualitative and quantitative investigations through public exhibitions. We found that there is a window of self-identification as well as a variety of interpersonal experiences in the facial morphing process.
From these insights, we synthesized a Self-Other Continuum represented by a sense of agency and facial identity. This continuum has implications in terms of the social and subjective aspects of interpersonal communication, which enables further scenario design and could complement findings from research on interactive devices for remote communication.",
Personal Health Sensing,Towards More Personal Health Sensing,"Junyi Zhu, Liang He, Jun Nishida, Hamid Ghaednia, Hsin-Liu Kao, Jon E. Froehlich, Edward Wang, Stefanie Mueller",ACM CHI 2022 SIG,2022,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516408,,,"With the development of low-cost electronics, rapid prototyping techniques, as well as widely available mobile devices (e.g. mobile phones, smart watches), projects related to the design and fabrication of personal health sensing applications, either on top of existing device platforms (e.g. mHealth), or as stand-alone devices, have emerged in the last decade. In addition, recent advances in novel sensing and interface technologies, accessibility studies and system design open up new possibilities and can bring in different perspectives for personal health sensing. We believe that joining the forces in such interdisciplinary work is a key to moving the field of personal health sensing forward. This Special Interest Group aims to bring in researchers from different fields, identify the significance and challenges of the personal health sensing domain, discuss potential solutions and future research directions, and promote collaborative research opportunities.",
Cyborgs dream,Do Cyborgs dream of Electric Limbs? Experiential Factors in Human-Computer Integration Design and Evaluation,"Valdemar Danry, Pat Pataranutaporn, Adam Haar Horowitz, Paul Strohmeier, Josh Andres, Rakesh Patibanda, Zhuying Li, Takuto Nakamura, Jun Nishida, Pedro Lopes, Felipe León, Andrea Stevenson Won, Dag Svanæs, Florian Floyd Mueller, Pattie Maes, Sang-won Leigh, and Nathan Semertzidis",ACM CHI 2021 Workshop,2021,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411763.3441355,,,"While many systems have successfully demonstrated functional integration of humans and technology, little attention has been paid to how technologies might experientially integrate to feel as part of humans. Our aim is to shed light on the importance of experiential integration and provide researchers with a scientifically driven foundation for future designs and investigations. The workshop will consist of hands-on experiments with novel body-illusions, discussions on experiential integration, and instructor-guided sessions on psychological concepts related to the design and evaluation of experiential integration.",
Outcome,Successful Outcomes in a Stroop Test Modulate the Sense of Agency When the Human Response and the Preemptive Response Actuated by Electrical Muscle Stimulation are Aligned,"Daisuke Tajima, Jun Nishida, Pedro Lopes, and Shunichi Kasahara",Journal of Vision,2020,https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2771371,,,"The sense of agency (SoA) refers to the sensation that I caused the action. Generally, one would expect that if moved passively by an external force, one would not feel an SoA. However, Kasahara (2018) have found that by using precise timing, the SoA was elicited even for EMS-actuated preemptive passive body movement in a simple reaction time task. This effect however only has been verified in the specific situation where the participant and the EMS device share the same goal of action. (i.e., both participant and device press a button as fast as possible). Here, we studied a more complex situation where a participant cooperates with an EMS-based device to perform a choice-task. In this case, device and participants’ answers will not always be aligned, e.g., at times the EMS-based device can choose the wrong answer or vice versa. We hypothesized that, If the underlying mechanism of the SoA would prefer to depend on the cognitive process of verifying the goal of own action and the outcome retrospectively, the apparent in/correct outcomes modulate the participant’s SoA. Participants performed two-alternative forced choice tasks of the Stroop-test by tapping with both hands and the EMS also actuated the participant’s hand to respond to the task, faster or slower than the participant’s voluntary movement. The EMS played two roles: assistive (forced success) or adversarial (forced failure). The result showed that, when the participant’s response and the EMS response were aligned, the SoA was significantly higher when the outcome was success rather than failure. In contrast, when their responses were not aligned, the SoA was elicited only when the outcome reflected the participant’s response regardless of the EMS’ response. These results support our hypothesis partly and imply that only when the outcome is sensed as one’s action, its outcome modulates the SoA postdictively.",
Joint Stiffness,Wearable Kinesthetic I/O Device for Sharing Wrist Joint Stiffness,"Jun Nishida, Keisuke Yagi, Modar Hassan and Kenji Suzuki",IEEE EMBC 2019,2019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8857538,,,"In this paper, we developed a wearable kinesthetic I/O system, which is able to share wrist joint stiffness by measuring and intervening in four muscle activities on the forearm simultaneously through the same electrodes. This achieves interactive peg rehabilitation by sharing muscle activities among patients and therapists. Through the performance study, it was shown that 1) applied EMS and measured wrist joint stiffness, and 2) produced wrist joint stiffness and measured EMG value has a linear correlation, which allows designing a mapping function between the measured EMG value on one person and the EMS value applied to another person. In a perceptual study, which shared the wrist stiffness between two persons, participants were able to recognize the level of their confederate's wrist joint stiffness using a 4-point Likert scale linearly. The developed system would benefit a physical therapist and a patient for sharing their wrist stiffness and grip force, which are usually difficult to be observed in a visual contact.",
Preemptive Action,Demonstrating Preemptive Reaction: Accelerating Human Reaction using Electrical Muscle Stimulation Without Compromising Agency,"Jun Nishida, Shunichi Kasahara, and Pedro Lopes",ACM SIGGRAPH Emerging Technologies,2019,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3305367.3327997,,,"In this demonstration we enable preemptive force-feedback systems to speed up human reaction time without fully compromising the user's sense of agency. Typically these haptic systems speed up human reaction time by means of electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) or mechanical actuation (exoskeletons), which unfortunately, completely remove the users sense of agency. We address this by actuating the user's body, using EMS, within a particular time window (160 ms after visual stimulus), which we found to speed up reaction time by 80 ms, while retaining a sense of agency. Here, we demonstrate this at the example of two applications: (1) taking a picture of a high-speed moving object in mid-flight, or (2) hit baseball with a toy gun.",Laval Virtual Grand Prize
HYPERSPECTIVE,HYPERSPECTIVE: Shaping Experiences beyond Perspectives,Jun Nishida and Kenji Suzuki,IEEE VR 2019 Workshop,2019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8797767,,,"Embodied knowledge of one's experiences are broadly categorized as tacit knowledge, that can be acquired through active physical experiences only and not by conversations or visual media. We hypothesize that shaping a person's bodily sensation, such as physical representation or a physiological characteristic, to that of another person, including a child or a patient, while allowing active, embodied, and social interactions with the surrounding objects and people in a real-world environment would provide an authentic as well as empathic knowledge to school teachers, product designers, and medical staff when designing living environments or communicating with them. We propose and demonstrate a new style to experience one's perspectives, called HYPERSPECTIVE (hyper + perspective), that can be achieved with wearable devices, and discuss its challenges, benefits, and feasibility in real scenarios.",
Muscle Compliance,Wearable Kinesthetic I/O Device for Sharing Muscle Compliance,Jun Nishida and Kenji Suzuki,ACM UIST 2019 Poster,2019,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3266037.3266100,,,"In this paper, we present a wearable kinesthetic I/O device, which is able to measure and intervene in multiple muscle activities simultaneously through the same electrodes. The developed system includes an I/O module, capable of measuring the electromyogram (EMG) of four muscle tissues, while applying electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) at the same time. The developed wearable system is configured in a scalable manner for achieving 1) high stimulus frequency (up to 70 Hz), 2) wearable dimensions in which the device can be placed along the limbs, and 3) flexibility of the number of I/O electrodes (up to 32 channels). In a pilot user study, which shared the wrist compliance between two persons, participants were able to recognize the level of their confederate's wrist joint compliance using a 4-point Likert scale. The developed system would benefit a physical therapist and a patient, during hand rehabilitation, using a peg board for sharing their wrist compliance and grip force, which are usually difficult to be observed in a visual contact.",
Wired Muscle,Wired Muscle: Generating Faster Kinesthetic Reaction by Inter-personally Connecting Muscles,"Jun Nishida*, Shunichi Kasahara*, and Kenji Suzuki",ACM SIGGRAPH 2017 Emerging Technologies,2017,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3084822.3084844,,,"Instantaneously generating own body movements in response to the movement of others, such as establishing defensive posture in sports and learning kick-out timing from therapists in gait rehabilitation, is an essential aspect of interpersonal exercises and contact sports. However, ignition of movement based on a visual stimulus requires approximately 250 milliseconds (ms), which is too late for certain interpersonal physical interactions that require immediate reaction. Thus, we introduce ""Wired Muscle,"" a system that connects muscle activities between two persons using electromyogram (EMG) measurement and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) to generate responsive movement that are faster than those generated by the visual information-based process. Our system detects the muscle activity of a person by the EMG and triggers the EMS to drive the muscle of the other person to induce corresponding counter movements. In a pilot study using our system, the reaction time to the motion of another person could be shortened to approximately 60 ms. In addition, some participants perceive that the kinesthetic reaction was performed by their own will even though the muscle movement was electrically driven by prior stimuli. We envision that our system will enable direct connection of kinesthetic experiences among multiple persons and will form the basis for a novel paradigm of motor learning.",

This studio offers a hands-on exploration of potentially extreme versions of such benefits Systems and techniques that somehow share or transfer embodiment between two or more people. Through participatory demos, studio attendees will explore and compare a variety of approaches to experiencing the perspectives of another body, and controlling bodies other than their own. These comparisons will be a launch pad for collaboratively combining existing ""body sharing"" systems and mocking up new design concepts. By bringing together ideas and approaches in an actionable manner, this studio will share and develop imagination, theory, and skills relevant to the design and study of interactive systems in which the body plays a central role.",
bioSync,bioSync: Wearable Haptic I/O Device for Synchronous Kinesthetic Interaction,Jun Nishida and Kenji Suzuki, IEEE VR 2016 Research Demos,2016,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7504744,,,"This paper presents a synchronous kinesthetic interaction among people through haptic input/output based on biosignal measurement and stimulation. Users are able to bi-directionally transmit kinesthetic experiences such as rigidity of joints or exertion of muscles in addition to physical bodily motion. Such interaction would be very important in the fields of rehabilitation and sports training. In this study, we introduce a set of wearable devices that is capable of both electromyogram (EMG) measurement and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) simultaneously on the same muscle by using common electrodes. To achieve smooth kinesthetic bi-directional interaction, we propose a new method for discharging the residual potential of the stimulation in order to enable fastest simultaneous operation (40Hz). Through a performance evaluation, participants could recognize the teacher's exertion strength on a 5-point scale without visual information.",Best Demo Honorable Mention Award

CHILDHOOD,CHILDHOOD: Wearable Suit for Augmented Child Experience,"Jun Nishida, Hikaru Takatori, Kosuke Sato and Kenji Suzuki",ACM SIGGRAPH 2015 Emerging Technologies,2015,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2782782.2792501,,,"Understanding and perceiving the world from a child's perspective is a very important key not only to design products and architecture, but also to remind staff who work closely with children, such as hospitals and kindergartens. Ida et al. investigated the universality of devices and architecture in public spaces by recording videos through a hand-held camera positioned at a child's eye level [Ida et al. 2010]. In this study, we propose a novel wearable suit called CHILDHOOD that virtually realizes a child's eye and hand movements by attaching a viewpoint translator and hand exoskeletons (Figure 1a). We hypothesized that virtualizing a child's body size by transforming our own body while preserving embodied interactions with actual surroundings would provide an augmented experience of a child's perspective. This could assist designers in evaluating product accessibility through their own body interactions in real time. In addition, augmented child experience can help staff and parents remember how children feel and touch the world.",
